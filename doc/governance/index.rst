Ceph Governance
---------------

Key principles
==============

  * Decision-making is consensus-driven by those who show up.
  * Leadership roles are defined primary by responsibility, not prestige or seniority.
    * It is normal and healthy for these roles to be passed on to others
  * The role of developers is ultimately to serve the users.

Bodies
------

Ceph Executive Council
======================

  * [3 or 5] people
  * selected by steering committee during leadership summit
    * candidates self-nominate or are nominated by other members
    * discussion of how roles/responsibilities may be delegated
    * propose 1 or more council sets
    * ranked-choice vote by steering committee
  * 1 year term (i.e., a release cycle) (or staggered longer terms?)

Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * arbiter in cases where decisions cannot be reached by consensus
 * distribute key responsibilities amongst themselves or others
 * ensure things get done

Ceph Steering Committee
=======================

Membership
^^^^^^^^^^

 * senior developers, users, community members
 * Target size: low 10s
 * Existing CLT members are grandfathered in
 * Members can be nominated and added/removed by existing members (2/3 majority)
 * Term is normally 2 years, at which point they can be re-added or rotate out
 * Membership reflected by a github group (should be on website,  docs, email list too)
