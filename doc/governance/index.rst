Ceph Governance
---------------

Key principles
==============

 * Decision-making is consensus-driven by those who show up.
 * Leadership roles are defined primarily by responsibility, not prestige or seniority.
   * It is normal and healthy for these roles to be passed on to others
 * Everyone's role is ultimately to serve the users and participation
   is voluntary.
